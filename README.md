This challenge was to create a note take using express.js. With this application anyone user can go and access byt lisiting to the local host port that is created in this project which is 3000. Once listing on that server you will be able to create and store your note. On the right side is where you would input your notes. Once you are finish writing your note with a note title a save icon button will appear and you will then be able to save. Once saved you will see the note stored on the right hand side of the webpage. At first I created seperate route folders but was running into an error causing the application not to work. I moved them out of the develpp folder and put all the code on one file, (server.js) and everything worked smoothly. Even though I didnt have to put all the route in one folder and the reason the routes was not being read was because of the location they was in. Nonetheless, everything works fine and any user can access and create and store notes
